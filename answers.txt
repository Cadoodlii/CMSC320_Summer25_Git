Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is helpful for keeping track of different versions and the history of a project. 
It allows developers to recall projects to a previous version, and cleanly collaborate on the same project by allowing multiple copies of a project to be merged together.
Developers can work on different sections of a project using the branches feature and test out new ideas without interfering with other branches. 
Using the distributed version control system, developers can work on their own local repositories and push/pull as necessary to the main server. 

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Medicine - After researchers collect sample data about the effectiveness of new drugs, they need to use data science principles to determine whether or not the new drug will be effective for the general population.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging preserves the history of the project's branches, which can help developers see the original workflow. All merge conflicts are handled at once in the merge commit.
Rebasing pulls forward the changes made in a feature branch from the original common ancestor with the main branch to the most recent commit in the main branch. 
So each original commit can be handled as if it were made upon the most recent version of main. This creates a linear history (which may look cleaner), whereas merging maintains a parallel branch history.
